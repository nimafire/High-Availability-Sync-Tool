# Failover Manager

**Failover Manager** is a lightweight high-availability script that manages a **floating IP** and keeps two servers synchronized using **rsync + NFS mounts**.  
It ensures that when the master server goes down and the floating IP switches to the slave, data remains consistent.  
When the master comes back online, the script automatically synchronizes changes back.

---

## Features
- Automatic floating IP monitoring
- Switch between **NFS (master active)** and **local storage (failover mode)**
- Bi-directional synchronization (master â†” local)
- Systemd service for auto start & restart
- Logging to `/var/log/failover_manager.log`

---

## Requirements
- Linux server (tested on Ubuntu/Debian)
- `rsync` installed on both servers
- `nfs-common` (or equivalent) installed
- Root SSH access between servers
- Two servers + one floating IP
